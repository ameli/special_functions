            # (libcudart.so, libcublas.so, libcusparse.so) will bundle to

            # anaconda cloud upload size is 1GB, the large wheel size will not
            # be a problem. The advantage of bundling cuda libraries to the
            # wheel is that the end-user does not have to install cuda toolkit.
