# The purpose of this file is to load the compiled Fortran libraries, only
# on windows. When the amos library is compiled with Fortran, in  windows
# platform, a DLL file for the file _extern/amos/mach/d1mach.f is generated.
# When this package is installed, this DLL file is placed in a sub-directory of
# the package, in python/site-packages/special_functions/.libs. Unfortunately,
# because this DLL file is in a subfolder (.libs), the package cannot load
# properly. Calling this file will add the .libs subdirectory of the package to
# the path environment variable. To use it, simply import this file in either
# __init__.py or __init__.pxd.
#
# This file is inherited from scipy, and it is generated during the compilation
# using ``config.make_config_py()`` in setup.py. Here, we do not need to auto-
# generated this file.
