def RecursiveGlob(Directory, Patterns):
    """
    Recursively searches all subdirectories of a given directory and looks for
    a list of patterns. If in a subdirectory, one of the patterns is found, the
    name of the first immediate subdirectory (after Directory) is returned in a
    list.

    For example, is the pattern is '*.so',

    Directory
    |
    |-- SubDirectory-1
    |   |
    |   |--File-1.so
    |

    |-- SubDirectory-3
    |   |
    |   |--File-3.a

    This code outputs ['SubDirectory-1','SubDirectory-2']. Note that the
    `SubSubDirectory-2` is not in the output, since it is part of the
    `SubDirectory-2'. That is, this code only outputs the first children
    subdirectory if within that subdirectory a match of pattern is found.

    .. note::

        In python 3, this function ``glob(dir,recursive=True)`` can be simply
        used. However, the recursive glob is not supproted in python 2 version
        of ``glob``, hence this function is written.
